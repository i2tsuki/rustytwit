//! Structs and functions for working with statuses and timelines.
//!
//! In this module, you can find various structs and methods to load and interact with tweets and
//! their metadata. This also includes loading a user's timeline, posting a new tweet, or liking or
//! retweeting another tweet. However, this does *not* include searching for tweets; that
//! functionality is in the [`search`][] module.
//!
//! [`search`]: ../search/index.html
//!
//! ## Types
//!
//! - `Tweet`/`TweetEntities`/`ExtendedTweetEntities`: At the bottom of it all, this is the struct
//!   that represents a single tweet. The `*Entities` structs contain information about media,
//!   links, and hashtags within their parent tweet.
//! - `DraftTweet`: This is what you use to post a new tweet. At present, not all available options
//!   are supported, but basics like marking the tweet as a reply and attaching a location
//!   coordinate are available.
//! - `Timeline`: Returned by several functions in this module, this is how you cursor through a
//!   collection of tweets. See the struct-level documentation for details.
//!
//! ## Functions
//!
//! ### User actions
//!
//! These functions perform actions on their given tweets. They require write access to the
//! authenticated user's account.
//!
//! - `delete` (for creating a tweet, see `DraftTweet`)
//! - `like`/`unlike`
//! - `retweet`/`unretweet`
//!
//! ### Metadata lookup
//!
//! These functions either perform some direct lookup of specific tweets, or provide some metadata
//! about the given tweet in a direct (non-`Timeline`) fashion.
//!
//! - `show`
//! - `lookup`/`lookup_map` (for the differences between these functions, see their respective
//!   documentations.)
//! - `retweeters_of`
//! - `retweets_of`
//!
//! ### `Timeline` cursors
//!
//! These functions return `Timeline`s and can be cursored around in the same way. See the
//! documentation for `Timeline` to learn how to navigate these return values. This correspond to a
//! user's own view of Twitter, or with feeds you might see attached to a user's profile page.
//!
//! - `home_timeline`/`mentions_timeline`/`retweets_of_me`
//! - `user_timeline`/`liked_by`
